# SHA-256 -- FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY; DO NOT USE THIS IMPLEMENTATION FOR ENCRYPTION OR SECURITY
Python 3 implementation of SHA-256 secure hash algorithm.

Note: this code was written for clarity of the steps of the algorithm (no comment on whether clarity was actually achieved) rather than performance, and is still sloppy. Not suitable for use in any cryptographic or security contexts.

run from command line: python SHA_256.py 'MESSAGE TO BE HASHED'
